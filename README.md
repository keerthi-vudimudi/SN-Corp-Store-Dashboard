This is my second project in Power BI, where I’ve deepened my understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques. The interactive dashboard developed for SN Corp focuses on various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor critical business metrics. 
The dashboard utilizes advanced features of Power BI, such as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), dynamic charts, and interactive visualizations, to provide actionable insights into the store's performance and operational efficiency.

# Key Objectives

Sales Performance Monitoring: Track and analyze sales trends across different time periods, helping stakeholders identify growth areas and seasonal fluctuations.
Customer Insights: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior, allowing for personalized marketing strategies and improved customer retention.
Product Analysis: Evaluate the performance of various products, identifying top-sellers and underperforming items for inventory management and promotional planning.
Store Efficiency: Monitor operational metrics such as inventory levels and turnover rates, providing insights to improve store efficiency.
Financial Overview: Offer a clear and concise overview of revenue, profit margins, and other financial KPIs to assess the store's financial health.
Data Source The dataset for this project includes transactional data, product information, and customer demographics. With over 4,100 rows of data, this dataset forms a robust foundation for in-depth analysis and trend discovery.

# Analysis Techniques

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Provided quick snapshots of crucial business metrics like total sales, average order value, and customer satisfaction scores.
DAX Formulas: Leveraged DAX for creating calculated fields and measures, enabling dynamic and flexible data analysis.
Data Visualizations: Developed a variety of visual elements, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and stacked columns, to present data in a visually engaging way and highlight key insights.
Interactive Features: Integrated slicers, filters, and cross-reporting options to make the dashboard more interactive, enabling users to explore data from multiple perspectives and gain deeper insights.
Results and Insights

Top-Performing Products: Identified the top 10 products contributing the most to sales, providing direction for future inventory and promotional strategies.
Customer Segmentation: Found that a particular customer segment consistently generates the highest revenue, presenting an opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns.
Sales Trends: Observed a significant increase in sales during festive seasons, offering valuable insights for timing future sales campaigns and stock management.

The SN Corp Store Dashboard offers a comprehensive and interactive analysis of the store’s operations. By using Power BI’s data visualization and analysis capabilities, the dashboard provides key insights that support strategic decision-making. The interactive elements empower users to explore the data from multiple angles, ensuring a more informed and holistic view of the business’s performance.

# How to Use

Open the Power BI file (SNCorpDashboard.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
Explore different tabs, charts, and visualizations to understand the insights derived from the data.
Use the interactive slicers and filters to customize the dashboard view based on specific business needs or areas of focus.

This project allowed me to further develop my skills in Power BI, particularly in creating dynamic and interactive dashboards, while reinforcing the importance of data storytelling in business analysis.
